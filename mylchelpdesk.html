      <p>This guide walks you through logging in for the first time and setting up authentication.</p>

      <h3>First-Time Login</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://leecollege.onelogin.com" target="_blank">leecollege.onelogin.com</a>.</li>
        <li>Enter your Lee College email address and click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
        <li>Enter your network password and click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
        <li>You'll be prompted to set up 2-Factor Authentication. Click <strong>Begin Setup</strong>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Authentication Options</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OneLogin Protect App:</strong> Recommended. Scan the QR code using the app.</li>
        <li><strong>SMS Text:</strong> Receive a code via text.</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticator App:</strong> Use another preferred app like Google Authenticator.</li>
        <li><em>Email option coming soon.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>After Setup</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Log in to apps like Blackboard, Email, or MyLC Campus through the OneLogin dashboard.</li>
        <li>You may not see all apps at first — they’ll appear as integrations are completed.</li>
        <li>To reset your password later, click your name at the top right and select "Profile."</li>

      <h2>Web Conferencing Guide</h2>
      <p>Lee College supports two main tools for attending live classes or virtual meetings: <strong>WebEx</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong>. These tools are accessible through your Microsoft 365 account and allow you to attend lectures, participate in group assignments, or present assignments online.</p>

      
      <h4> Using WebEx</h4>
      <p>WebEx is used for live online classes or instructor-led presentations. Your instructor will provide a WebEx link inside your Blackboard course.</p>

<h3> Accessing WebEx through OneLogin</h3>

  <li>Go to the <a href="https://leecollege.onelogin.com/" target="_blank">Lee College OneLogin portal</a>.</li>
  <li>Log in with your Lee College email and password.</li>
  <li>On the dashboard, select the <strong>WebEx</strong> app icon.</li>
  <li>You will be taken directly to the WebEx platform where you can join or host meetings in your browser — no download needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your instructor has scheduled a session, you may also see the WebEx link inside your Blackboard course under <strong>Course Content</strong>.</p>

      <h3>How to Join a WebEx Session</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your Blackboard course and select the <strong>Course Content</strong> area.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>WebEx</strong> link provided by your instructor.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Join</strong> for the session you are attending.</li>
        <li>If prompted, choose to <strong>Open in WebEx App</strong> (recommended) or <strong>Join from browser</strong>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Downloading WebEx</h3>
      <p>Although you can use WebEx in your browser through OneLogin, installing the app gives you better performance and access to all features.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visit the <a href="https://www.webex.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Cisco WebEx Download Page</a>.</li>
        <li>Select the correct download for your computer or mobile device.</li>

        <li>Choose <strong>Everyone</strong> to message all participants.</li>
        <li>Type your message and press <strong>Enter</strong> to send.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Sharing Your Screen or Files</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>Share</strong> button at the bottom of the session window.</li>
        <li>Select the application or screen you want to share.</li>
        <li>For videos, choose <em>“Optimize for motion and video”</em> before sharing.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Whiteboard and File Sharing</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Share</strong>, then scroll to find <strong>Whiteboard</strong> or <strong>File</strong>.</li>
        <li>Use Whiteboard to draw or annotate content during your session.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Stop Sharing</h3>
      <p>When finished, click the red <strong>Stop Sharing</strong> button at the top of your shared screen.</p>

      <h3> Additional Features for Instructors</h3>

      <h3>Breakout Groups</h3>
      <p>Your instructor may assign you to breakout rooms for group activities. You'll have presenter controls and can share content with your group. Once the session ends, you’ll return to the main room automatically.</p>

      <h3>Polls</h3>
      <p>Instructors may launch polls during class. When active, polls appear on your screen, and results may be shared afterward. Look for the poll icon near the raise-hand button.</p>



<h4> Accessing Microsoft Teams</h4>

      <h2>CyberSecurity</h2>
      <p>Security programs or utilities that reveal or exploit weaknesses in the security of a system or that reveal data by circumventing established authorization procedures and systems should not be downloaded and/or used, except as authorized by the OIT. For example, password cracking programs, packet sniffers, wireless hubs or port scanners on Lee College Information Resources shall not be used. Users must report any identified weaknesses in Lee College computer security and any incidents of possible misuse or violation of this agreement to the director of Information Technology.</p>
      <p>Due to the open and decentralized design of the Internet and networked computer systems, Lee College cannot protect individuals against the receipt of material that may be offensive to them. Likewise, individuals who use email or those who make information about themselves public on the Internet should know that Lee College cannot protect them from invasions of privacy. It is recommended that users utilize the network only for business related activities of the college.</p>
      <p>Do not download and/or use tools that are normally used to assess security or to attack computer systems or networks (i.e. password “crackers”, vulnerability scanners, network sniffers, etc.) unless you have been specifically authorized to do so by I.T.</p>
      <p>Each user is responsible for the security of any system he/she connects to the network. A system seen to be attacking other systems, e.g. having fallen victim to viruses/worms, will be taken off the network, generally without notice, until it has been made secure.</p>
      <p>Users may not operate network services from their computers (BBS, Chat, DHCP, DNS, anonymous FTP, IRC, NNTP, POP2/POP3, SMTP, etc.). Users who have a bona fide academic need to operate such services must obtain written authorization from the OIT Director prior to activating any such service.</p>
      <p>Users may not conduct port scans on the campus network, or of outside networks from the campus network, may not operate Ethernet cards in promiscuous mode, or use any IP address on the campus network other than those assigned by the College.</p>
      <p>Lee College network services and wiring may not be modified or extended. This applies to network wiring, hardware, and in-room jacks. Use of Ethernet switches, network hubs, or wireless networking technology on the campus network is expressly prohibited and can impose unnecessary security vulnerability on the network.</p>
      <p>A computer owned personally by a student, faculty member or staff member is subject to College policy while it connects to the College network directly or through a dial-up connection. An individual may not grant access privileges to other individuals on a computer in violation of the general eligibility policy below, even if that computer is personally owned. If a computer is connected to the College network, access from that computer to the rest of the campus network can only be made available to individuals otherwise authorized to use the campus network. This includes email, Web services, file transfer, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), telnet, and any other network traffic.</p>
      <p>The installation of any type of device that allows the sharing of a single IP address by multiple devices compromises the operation of the network and must not occur. This includes proxy servers, personal routers or any other type of network equipment. It is expected that each end-user device will be configured with a single registered IP address from the campus Network Operations Center.</p>
      <p>The College is bound by its contractual and license agreements respecting certain third party resources; you are expected to comply with all such agreements when using such resources.</p>

In the case of harassment complaints, illegal violations, or a system problem — hardware, software, or attacks by hackers — the IT staff is authorized to review any information or files necessary to investigate complaints or solve the systems problems to protect the systems and the information they contain. In this situation, the staff is obligated to treat any information they might see that turns out to be unrelated to the problem as strictly confidential. In addition, email messages may be subject to subpoena or otherwise discoverable in litigation.</p>
      <p>Users should follow local, state, and federal laws and regulations pertaining to computing activities. In cases involving fraud, forgery, extortion, copyright, intimidation, humiliation, etc., violators may be legally prosecuted and will be subject to immediate loss of all computing privileges at Lee College.</p>
      <p>Attempt to alter or obscure your identity or your computer’s identity, including but not limited to IP address and email address, while communicating on any network.</p>
      <p>Attempts to alter system software, to bypass security protocols, to introduce viruses, worms, or other malicious or destructive programs, or otherwise “to hack” are expressly forbidden. Any member of the Lee College community, including students, who intentionally breaches security, will be subject to disciplinary action, including suspension and dismissal and legal proceedings.</p>
      <p>The College District reserves the right to conduct searches when the College District has reasonable cause to believe that a search will uncover evidence of work-related misconduct. The College District may search the employee, the employee’s personal items, work areas, lockers and private vehicles parked on College District premises or work sites or used in College District business. Work areas include technology equipment provide by the college such as computers and peripherals, servers, laptops, PDAs and telephones/cell phones.
